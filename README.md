# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This repository contains a handwritten digit recognition project built with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It demonstrates how machine learning can be used to classify digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits with high accuracy. This project showcases the entire pipeline, including:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Model building and training
3. Model evaluation
4. Deployment using a web interface

## Features
- **Dataset**: MNIST dataset (70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits)
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras
